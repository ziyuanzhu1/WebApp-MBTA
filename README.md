# WebApp-MBTA

# Project Overview

The goal of the project was to create an interactive website that helps find the nearest MBTA station based on user input. The overall project integrates both Python and HTML using Flask. When the user enters the first page, they will automatically be asked what location they want to find the nearest station. After inputting the location, Python will take the longitude and latitude  through Mapquest and MBTA APIs and find the closest MBTA station. Then, they will take you to a blue page website that gives you the MBTA station name. 


# Project Reflection

The project started out pretty rough, but after some time and collaboration the project ended up going relatively well. Since we both had no previous experience working with HTML, we struggled at first to incorporate HTML user inputs that would work with Python. In order to overcome this large obstacle, we used reddit threads and StackOverflow as resources that provided useful information to help us better understand how to more efficiently merge the two languages and create an output that we were satisfied with. Although we were able to create a program that worked, we wish we had more experience with HTML and hoped to create a program that would be more aesthetically pleasing. However, the only thing we were able to do was incorporate an aqua-colored background in the results page. Going forward in the class, we hope to learn more on the uses of HTML to create a finished product that is significantly more appealing. 

We originally planned to divide the work evenly and code together, but because both of our schedules filled up with midterms and extracurricular activities. We ended up deciding that the best course of action was to split the work and code on our own. We would write small portions of the code at a time and then send our code to each other to look over. One of the things we learned to clarify is defining variables. Because both of us defined our variables differently, our program inevitably ran into numerous errors. 

Other than that, we did not encounter many issues along the way in terms of collaboration within the group, however, we believe that allocating more time for partner programming would be significantly more efficient than our current method of distributing work. Going forward, we will create a work timeline that would better fit both of our busy schedules.
